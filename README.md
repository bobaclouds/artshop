# Artshop
**Welcome to Boba Clouds' Art shop!**
### About the shop
&#10147; This "shop" sells handmade art of a person (not a bot) in the username "boba clouds". I use Apple Pencil, Procreate, and of course, iPad. You will expect to see different types of avatars, wall papers, and perhaps gifs or emojis. 

&#10147; If you want me to draw an avatar for you or if you thought of something great to draw, email me!

### About the website
&#10147; If, for some reason, you came across this github repository and you don't know where you are, visit the website at <href a="https://bobaclouds.github.io/artshop">https://bobaclouds.github.io/artshop</a>.

&#10147; As of now, the website isn't fully constructed and you will probably see some art samples instead of where to buy the avatars themselves. [This bullet point subject to change].
